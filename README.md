My capstone project for General Assembly DSI-Flex-222

## Option 1: Wind Prediction

Every year, thousands of Americans are forced to plan backcountry trips well in advance due to logistics such as affordable plane tickets and getting time off from work. While there are general guidelines and weather forecast data available, there is quite a bit of footwork in determining what window to aim for for backcountry trips. This project will use NREL's WIND Toolkit data model to offer users a prediction of the best wind weather window given a location within the United States. More weather metrics, such as temperature and precipitation, will be added as time allows.
